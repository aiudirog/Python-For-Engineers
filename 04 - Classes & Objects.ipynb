    "Python is an Object Orientated Language. Objects are data structures which can store data and also operate on that data through special functions referred to as methods. In fact, every data structure you have seen in Python (or will ever see) is an object. Lists, dictionaries, integers, strings, and everything else are all examples of objects built into Python. However, in order to leverage the full power of the language, we need to start making our own. To do that, we have to define what data our object will store and what methods it will have to work with. To do that, we create classes. Classes are like blueprints: they define the layout of the data structure and can be used as guidelines to produce many instances (objects) of the class. (Classes themselves are technically objects because everything is an object in Python, but that doesn't really matter right now:P)"

We could make a whole fleet of cars and they would all maintain independent states that can be modified through methods. This is how things like lists and dictionaries are able to add new elements. With the immutable objects like integers and strings, those methods return a new instance of the class with the required modifications as their own internal state can't be changed.
