Handling these exceptions is done through the `try...except` structure. If an exception occurs inside of the `try` block, each of the `except` blocks will be checked to see if they apply. The keywords `else` and `finally` can also be used after the `except` blocks but are not required. Code inside the `else` block runs if no error occurred inside of the `try` block. Code inside of the `finally` block runs regardless of whether or not an error occurred, even if the exception wasn't handled.
